        "Rationale": "explanation : let us consider that speed of train , first man and second man are respectively t , f and s . according to first given condition goods train crossed the first person moving in same direction in 20 sec . so length of the will be 20 ( t - f ) similarly train crossed the second man in 18 sec . so length of the train will be 18 ( t + s ) on comparing these two equations , we get 20 ( t - f ) = 18 ( t + s ) = > 2 t = 20 f + 18 s = > t = 10 f + 9 s now it is given that after 10 min the train crossed the other person who is coming in opposite direction . so , if we consider this way of train as l then the next equation will be l = 600 t ( here 600 is used for 10 minutes ) finally as asked in the question the time required to meet the two man after the train has passed will be given by time = ( l - 600 f ) / ( f + s ) { here 600 f is used for the distance traveled by first man in 10 minutes } = > = ( 600 t - 600 f ) / ( f + s ) = > = [ 600 ( 10 f + 9 s ) - 600 f ] / ( f + s ) = > = 600 ( 10 f + 9 s - f ) / ( f + s ) = 600 * 9 ( f + s ) / ( f + s ) = > = 600 * 9 seconds = > = 600 * 9 / 60 min = > = 90 minutes hence ( b ) is the correct answer . answer : b",

( b ) 2 of the 3 investments become worthless , while 1 doesn ’ t . outcome ( a ) : the probability is ( 0.2 ) ( 0.2 ) ( 0.2 ) = 0.008 , or a little less than 1 % . outcome ( b ) : call the investments x , y , and z . the probability that x retains value , while y and z become worthless , is ( 0.8 ) ( 0.2 ) ( 0.2 ) = 0.032 . now , we have to do the same thing for the specific scenarios in which y retains value ( while x and z don ’ t ) and in which z retains value ( while x and y don ’ t ) . each of those scenarios results in the same math : 0.032 . thus , we can simply multiply 0.032 by 3 to get 0.096 , or a little less than 10 % . the sum of these two probabilities is 0.008 + 0.096 = 0.104 , or a little more than 10 % . finally , subtracting from 100 % and rounding , we find that the probability we were looking for is approximately 90 % . the correct answer is a . this problem illustrates the power of diversification in financial investments . all else being equal , it ’ s less risky to hold a third of your money in three uncorrelated ( independent ) but otherwise equivalent investments than to put all your eggs in one of the baskets . that said , be wary of historical correlations ! housing price changes in different us cities were not so correlated — and then they became highly correlated during the recent housing crisis ( they all fell together ) , fatally undermining spreadsheet models that assumed that these price changes were independent .",

        "Rationale": "we can first set up our ratio using variable multipliers . we are given that a fruit - salad mixture consists of apples , peaches , and grapes , in the ratio of 6 : 5 : 2 , respectively , by weight . thus , we can say : apples : peaches : grapes = 6 x : 5 x : 2 x we are given that 39 pounds of the mixture is prepared so we can set up the following question and determine a value for x : 9 x + 6 x + 5 x = 40 20 x = 40 x = 2 now we can determine the number of pounds of apples and of grapes . pounds of grapes = ( 5 ) ( 2 ) = 10 pounds of apples = ( 9 ) ( 2 ) = 18 thus we know that there are 18 – 10 = 8 more pounds of apples than grapes . answer is c .",
